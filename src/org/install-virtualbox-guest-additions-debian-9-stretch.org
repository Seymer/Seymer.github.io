This tutorial will show you how to install VirtualBox guest additions in a Debian 9 virtual machine. You need to have a Debian 9 guest OS installed inside VirtualBox to follow the instructions. The type of host OS doesn’t matter.

*** What is VirtualBox Guest Additions?

VirtualBox guest additions offer the following capabilities:

Enable users to seamlessly move mouse pointer between host and guest.
Allow guest OS to have read and write access to hard drives on the host OS.
Power up the graphics ability of your guest machine. The screen resolution of guest machine can be automatically adjusted and 3D graphics can be accelerated.
Enable bidirectional shared clipboard between host and guest.


*** How to Install VirtualBox Guest Additions in Debian 9

Boot up your Debian 9 virtual machine. Then switch to root with the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
su -
#+END_EXAMPLE

Next, update software.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt update

apt upgrade
#+END_EXAMPLE

If a new Linux kernel is installed in the upgrade process, then you need to reboot Debian 9 VM. After that, run the following command to install required packages for building kernel modules.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt install build-essential module-assistant dkms
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once the above packages are installed, prepare your Debian 9 system to build kernel module, which is done with the command below.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
m-a prepare
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then in the VirtualBox window, select Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image.

You will be asked if you want to run the software. Select Run.

If your host OS doesn’t have the guest additions CD image, then it will ask you to click a button to download the CD image onto the host machine.You can manually download it from http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox.

Ubuntu-based Linux distro can also download the CD image with the following command (with root privilege).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you click the Run button, the CD image is mounted at /media/cdrom/ directory. Under /media/cdrom/ directory there’s a shell script named VboxLinuxAdditions.run. Run this script (with root privilege).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once guest additions is installed, restart your Debian 9 VM.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
shutdown -r now
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now the resizeable display should be working and the resolution of Debian 9 VM will adjust with the size of VirtulBox window.  You can press right Ctrl and F keyboard shortcut to enter full-screen mode. You can now also configure shared folder and bidirectional shared clipboard.
