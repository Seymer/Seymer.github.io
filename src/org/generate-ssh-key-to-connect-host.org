*** Creating a new SSH key
If you do not have an existing private SSH key file and a matching public SSH key file that you can use, generate a new SSH key. If you want to use an existing SSH key, locate the public SSH key file.

1. Open a terminal on your workstation and use the ssh-keygen command to generate a new key. Specify the -C flag to add a comment with your username.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] -C [USERNAME]
#+END_EXAMPLE


2. Restrict access to your private key so that only you can read it and nobody can write to it.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Locating an SSH key
If you created a key on a Linux or macOS workstation by using the ssh-keygen tool, your key was saved to the following locations:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+ Public key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME].pub
+ Private key file: ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Connect to instance
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh -i ~/.ssh/[KEY_FILENAME] [HOSTNAME/HOSTIP]
#+END_EXAMPLE
